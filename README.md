## Perceiver - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03206">Perceiver</a>, General Perception with Iterative Attention, in Pytorch.
Extended from Phil Wang's <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/perceiver-pytorch">perceiver-pytorch</a>

## Install

```bash
$ pip install perceiver-model
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from perceiver_pytorch import Perceiver

model = Perceiver(
    input_channels = 3,          # number of channels for each token of the input
    input_axis = 2,              # number of axis for input data (2 for images, 3 for video)
    num_freq_bands = 6,          # number of freq bands, with original value (2 * K + 1)
    max_freq = 10.,              # maximum frequency, hyperparameter depending on how fine the data is
    depth = 6,                   # depth of net. The shape of the final attention mechanism will be:
                                 #   depth * (cross attention -> self_per_cross_attn * self attention)
    num_latents = 256,           # number of latents, or induced set points, or centroids. different papers giving it different names
    latent_dim = 512,            # latent dimension
    cross_heads = 1,             # number of heads for cross attention. paper said 1
    latent_heads = 8,            # number of heads for latent self attention, 8
    cross_dim_head = 64,         # number of dimensions per cross attention head
    latent_dim_head = 64,        # number of dimensions per latent self attention head
    num_classes = 1000,          # output number of classes
    attn_dropout = 0.,
    ff_dropout = 0.,
    weight_tie_layers = False,   # whether to weight tie layers (optional, as indicated in the diagram)
    fourier_encode_data = True,  # whether to auto-fourier encode the data, using the input_axis given. defaults to True, but can be turned off if you are fourier encoding the data yourself
    self_per_cross_attn = 2      # number of self attention blocks per cross attention
)

img = torch.randn(1, 224, 224, 3) # 1 imagenet image, pixelized

model(img) # (1, 1000)
```

For the backbone of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14795">Perceiver IO</a>, the follow up paper that allows for flexible number of output sequence length, just import `PerceiverIO` instead

```python
import torch
from perceiver_pytorch import PerceiverIO

model = PerceiverIO(
    dim = 32,                    # dimension of sequence to be encoded
    queries_dim = 32,            # dimension of decoder queries
    logits_dim = 100,            # dimension of final logits
    depth = 6,                   # depth of net
    num_latents = 256,           # number of latents, or induced set points, or centroids. different papers giving it different names
    latent_dim = 512,            # latent dimension
    cross_heads = 1,             # number of heads for cross attention. paper said 1
    latent_heads = 8,            # number of heads for latent self attention, 8
    cross_dim_head = 64,         # number of dimensions per cross attention head
    latent_dim_head = 64,        # number of dimensions per latent self attention head
    weight_tie_layers = False    # whether to weight tie layers (optional, as indicated in the diagram)
)

seq = torch.randn(1, 512, 32)
queries = torch.randn(1, 128, 32)

logits = model(seq, queries = queries) # (1, 128, 100) - (batch, decoder seq, logits dim)
```
